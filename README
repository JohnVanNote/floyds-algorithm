This python program creates a all-pairs shortest path matrix determining the
minimum distance between nodes in a weighted graph (known as the
Floyd-Warshall algorithm). For more information on the algoritm specifically
reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm.

The input for the program is best done from a flat file, the file syntax is
best shown viewing either example.input or example2.input. The program
slerps the information, creates a predecessor (naive) matrix and then
calculates the "all-pairs shortest path matrix". 

Two examples of input of provided in example.input and example2.input, both
can be tested with the commands:
$> make test1
AND 
$> make test2
respectfully.

Taking input from the user directly can be done through
$> make run
but this is not recommended as it is error prone.

New input should be piped in from a file following the format in
example.input or example2.input.
